# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math module.
### Step 2: 
give the two co-ordinates for finding diatance.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](https://github.com/saiganesh2006/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/145742342/dac9d9ab-d470-4f46-b8f7-32ed5b7a8b0c)

### Step 4: 
Use the in-built sqrt function to find the distance.
### Step 5: 
Print the value of distance.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,y1=4,2
x2,y2=10,6
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
print("{0:.2f}".format(distance))
```
